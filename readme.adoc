== Prerequisites

=== Elasticsearch

You need a running instance of Elasticsearch available with version 7.6 x. You can start it with docker (the command should be given all in one line):

[code,shell]
----
docker run -p 9200:9200 -e "discovery.type=single-node" docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:7.6.2
----

== Running the application

The application can be started with
[code,shell]
----
mvn spring-boot:run
----

When the index in Elasticsearch does not exist, it is created and the sample data is loaded (189361 records).
